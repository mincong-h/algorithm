# 338 Counting Bits

<https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/>, Medium

## Description

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

Follow up:

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time
  `O(n*sizeof(integer))`. But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be O(n).
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like
  `__builtin_popcount` in c++ or in any other language.

## Idea

Iterate all number i between 0 and `num`, for each of them do a bit-count.

## Test Cases

```
5
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] arr = new int[num + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
            arr[i] = Integer.bitCount(i);
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```
